			<S.AboutTitle>OUR STORY</S.AboutTitle>
			<S.AboutDescription>For nearly 20 years, K.Sushi has been a family-owned spot in Cerritos where great food and genuine hospitality come together. We started as a mom-and-pop shop with one goal: to bring high-quality sushi and authentic Japanese comfort food to our community at prices that keep you coming back. Over the years, we've grown with our customers many of whom we now consider family.<br/><br/>
			Authentic Japanese Sushi - Fresh sashimi and classic rolls, never rushed, always made with pride.<br/>
			Korean-Japanese Fusion - Bold, spicy, and creative dishes you won't find anywhere else.<br/>
			At K.Sushi, you're not just a customer. You're family. Fresh ingredients, honest portions, and food made with love.</S.AboutDescription>
